# cprg211 - assignment 3 - Singly Linked Lists - Serialization and Testing
This project implements a Singly Linked List (SLL) data structure in C#, along with binary serialization functionality to persist data. It includes unit testing to verify the correctness of both the linked list operations and the serialization process.
## Features

- Custom implementation of a singly linked list

- Binary serialization and deserialization of list data

- Clear object-oriented structure using interfaces (LinkedListADT)

- Full unit test coverage using NUnit for:

- Linked list operations (e.g., append, delete, search)

- Serialization and deserialization processes

## Unit Testing

Unit tests are provided to ensure:

- Each linked list method works as intended

- Objects are correctly saved to and restored from a binary file
